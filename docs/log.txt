Note:

It just occurred to me that there is a need for GL resource disposal management.

This comes from the fact that switch between GL contexts has unspecified runtime cost. Because of that, delegating this to a callback (with possibly an added, optional "on completion" callback) would allow GSM to handle this: either calling the callback immediately if the context happens to be active [does GSM keep track of the active display/context?], or deferring it till after the buffer swap / presentation (or possibly only until the context becomes active).

- Observation: text rendering seems to be very slow (drop the framerate at insane rates) - why ?
  - Would it make sense to try and improve this using shaders ?
